This file contains main files used for the different configurations for the benchmarks. These are 
used in the benchmarks with symlinks. For example, (main.cpp) is used for all baseline
benchmarks, and any benchmark that does not require using a specific main file. Another example is
(watchdog_main.cpp), which is used for secure_watchdog benchmarks, and so on.
